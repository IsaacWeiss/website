            <h2>Commitment to diversity</h2>
            <p>The Wayne State University College of Education directs all of its pre-service teachers to include the text "Effective urban educators are committed to meet the needs of a diverse population" on their websites. A teacher must, indeed, have commitment: the work ethic to move mountains on students' behalf, and sufficient passion for the subject matter to make it interesting to anyone. But, in relation to diversity, I believe the real key is empathy.</p>
            <p>The typical school environment is not conducive to teachers treating students as individuals. The large groups of homogenous ages, the regimented schedules and seating arrangementsâ€”even the words we use, like "classes" and "grades," betray an inescapable worldview in which people (students are better understood as people) can be categorized, with the subtext that if a teacher understands a category he or she understands all students within it.</p>
            <p>This is bad. Dehumanizing, in fact.</p>
            <p>People are diverse.</p>
            <p>I believe that nothing can be assumedâ€”not even on the basis of age. Any set of guidelines for dealing with diversity will itself likely elide the diversity within the categories it discusses. What is most important is simply that a teacher be empathetic, in order to understand, because <em>every</em> individual is unique.</p>
            <p>Following are anecdotes about some unique situations I have encountered, illustrative of the diversity which exists in music education and the need for empathy it creates.</p>

            <h3>A traumatized student</h3>
            <p>Six weeks into my student teaching, the 7th grade Concert Orchestra was joined by a student who had just transferred to the district. A few days later, he was rushed to the hospital and received a five-day suspension for drinking alcohol in school to the point of incapacitation. This took me and my cooperating teacher completely by surprise. We knew only that he was a foster child and had had some problems at a previous home. I had spent a couple of days working with him one-on-one to catch him up with the rest of the class, and my impression was that he was quiet and bright, a fast learner. Mr. Rais shared my impression. Clearly that picture had been incomplete.
            </p>
            <p>The timing was unfortunate; we only had him for three block schedule rotations after that before in-personal classes were suspended again. He spent one of those days talking with my cooperating teacher in his office while I taught, and the other talkingâ€”but mostly workingâ€”with me while Mr. Rais taught. In short, it appears he had a history of abuse and neglect, and came from a very bad environment prior to his abrupt change of location. He got drunk, in an attempt to get high, in an attempt to alleviate symptoms of depression. He was twelve.</p>
            <p>I never fully appreciated the meaning of "creating a safe environment" until I found myself asking a twelve-year-old about his withdrawal symptoms. When I last saw him, he was at a crossroads in his life; he had the chance to make a fresh start. We talked about life goals and what it means to be a man. It is not easy to turn one's life around all in an instant, but I hope he succeeds.</p>
            <!--<p>Unfortunately, with the return to remote learning, we lost the connection; he "attended" class from home, but despite being called on by name every time, he never responded in any way.</p>-->

            <h3>Being the outsider</h3>
            <p>I have personal experience on the other side of the diversity question. A significant share of extant choral repertoire is directly transferred from Christian religious services. In my teens, as a homeschooler, I took high school classes in band, orchestra, music technology, and music theory, but never choir. I only asked the choral director once; while he expressed sympathy, to him it was absolutely necessary that his public school choir class should be taught Christian religious music. Any choir that requires the singing of Christian texts is closed to Orthodox Jews.</p>
            <p>As a college music student, more resolute, I negotiated that I would sing open vowels without consonants on the religious texts (e.g, "ah-oo ey-ee" while others sung "agnus dei"). For the concert, thankfully not performed in a church, I went bareheaded in order not to give the appearance of a Jew singing praise to Jesus. Still, that choir was an unhappy experience, and I had no desire to pursue it past one semester.</p>
            <p>Everyone should feel welcome in any music class. No cultural background should be excluded. Knowing what it is like to face barriers and uninterested teachers, I am committed to inclusion. When a student needs accommodations, I will make it work.</p>
