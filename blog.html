              <h3>The Medicine Cabinet</h3>
              <time datetime="2021-12-29">December 29, 2021</time>
              <div class="post-content">
                <p>There was a mirror over the sink, and a two-door medicine cabinet mounted on the wall above the toilet. Malka wanted floating shelves where the medicine cabinet was, and a medicine cabinet where the mirror was. The shelves were easy, not even worth posting about:</p>

                <p>The medicine cabinet‚Ä¶ whew. Now there‚Äôs a story.</p>
                <p>When you look for instructions on how to install a recessed medicine cabinet, they tell you to fit it between two wall studs if you can. If you can‚Äôt, because it wouldn‚Äôt be where you want or because it‚Äôs too wide (both of which were true in this case), you have to remove a segment of the stud that‚Äôs in your way and build a frame exactly the right size supported by the two neighboring studs.</p>
                <p>I started by cutting a small exploratory hole (not pictured), then enlarging it and adding a little cutout to  see the other side of the stud that would have to go, then drilling/sawing a hole sideways through that stud to peek at the other side.</p>
                <figure id="fig-2">
                  <a href="images/bathroom-project/fig-2.jpg" data-lightbox="fig-2">

                  </a>
                  <figcaption>Figure 2</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Already you can see two unforeseen issues:</p>
                <p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>A vertical electrical wire was stapled to the stud. By the time I took this picture I had already removed the staples and taped the wire to the back of the drywall on the far side; I determined that there was enough slack to just push the cabinet in and trap the wire in between the back of the cabinet and the far side of the cavity.</li>
                    <li>The drywall was screwed into the stud. Well, of course it would be. On this side, I just cut and tore and ripped the drywall off the screw. But what about the drywall attached to the other side? What was supposed to happen to that when I removed the stud entirely? I could patch the drywall if it got damaged. But, as it happens, this wall separated the bathroom from the kitchen. The other side of this wall was tiled!</li>
                  </ol>
                </p>
                <p>(Incidentally, this exact spot on the wall was directly opposite where we installed a microwave over the range. The vertical wire led up to the outlet we plugged the microwave into. Next to the stud, you can see the metal bolt and anchor coming through where Malka‚Äôs dad secured the mounting bracket. I cut the bolt as short as I safely could because it poked out too far and would prevent the insertion of the medicine cabinet from this side. This peculiarity meant that not only was drywall and tile attached to the other side of this stud, but so was a cabinet that now had an extremely heavy appliance dangling beneath it. This placed an upper bound‚Äîthe bottom edge of that cabinet‚Äîon the area of stud that could possibly be removed, and made it all the more important that we support that stud by its neighbors.)</p>
                <p>Happily, this particular interior wall was built with so-called 2‚Äùx6‚Äù studs instead of the standard so-called 2‚Äùx4‚Äù, in order to comfortably accommodate something called a vent stack, which relates to the plumbing. (The vent stack was picked up by the stud finder right where we wanted to install the floating shelves. I am extremely familiar with this wall by now.) With this extra depth, the medicine cabinet would not come close to the back of the cavity; I determined this would allow us to leave a portion of the stud in place, enough for the drywall screws to be undisturbed. Then we just had to figure out how to make a 26-inch-long vertical cut to remove only the front portion of the stud. Easy! Right?</p>
                <p>Well, so then I had to remove the drywall, making the cutout exactly where I wanted the cabinet to be, without variations in the straightness of the lines nor in the exactitude of the leveling. I got it done, perfectly level, perfectly plumb, just saving myself from making the catastrophic error of making the opening 20 inches wide instead of 19 and fifteen-sixteenths, the (approximately) true width of our medicine cabinet.</p>
                <figure id="fig-3">
                  <a href="images/bathroom-project/fig-3.jpg" data-lightbox="fig-3">

                  </a>
                  <figcaption>Figure 3</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>I also cut into the stud for the first time, just to make sure it wasn‚Äôt going to close up and suddenly reveal itself to be supporting the roof. It didn‚Äôt. The total distance between the two neighboring studs was 22+5/16‚Äù, one inch away from the cutout on the left and 1+3/8‚Äù away on the right. The white wire up top was dangling beneath the light fixture on this side, and had nothing to do with the electrical outlet on the other side where the microwave was attached.</p>
                <p>Uh-oh. Speaking of outlets. What‚Äôs that?</p>
                <figure id="fig-4">
                  <a href="images/bathroom-project/fig-4.jpg" data-lightbox="fig-4">
                    <img src="images/bathroom-project/fig-4.jpg" />
                  </a>
                  <figcaption>Figure 4</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>NOOOOOOOO</p>
                <p>Right at the corner. Just wide enough that, even if I shifted everything over the maximum inch and three-eighths rightward (jamming the cabinet against the next stud, and obviously having to restore the drywall inside the left edge of the first cutout), it would still prevent the cabinet from sliding in all the way.</p>
                <p>Right. That had to go.</p>
                <figure id="fig-5">
                  <a href="images/bathroom-project/fig-5.jpg" data-lightbox="fig-5">

                  <figcaption>Figure 5</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Oh, yes, we cut out the piece of stud along the way. I will not bore you with a painstaking description of the number of tools and different approaches we brought in. You‚Äôll notice that some parts of the cut are much cleaner than others (I worked on it more later):</p>
                <figure id="fig-2">
                  <a href="images/bathroom-project/fig-2.jpg" data-lightbox="fig-6">

                </figure>
                <p>Anyway. That junction box had to go. Luckily they make them in different sizes. The smallest one available would fit behind the back of the medicine cabinet, but but it might not be able to contain the GFCI receptacle and all its wires. I identified the solution and had it on standby, a box extender like this one:</p>
                <figure id="fig-7">
                  <a href="images/bathroom-project/fig-7.jpg" data-lightbox="fig-7">

                  </a>
                  <figcaption>Figure 2</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>However, it turned out that the drywall+tile provided the extra thickness and the extender wasn‚Äôt needed. So here you have it, the only time I am likely to ever use a new work junction box:</p>
                <figure id="fig-8">
                  <a href="images/bathroom-project/fig-8.jpg" data-lightbox="fig-8">

                  </a>
                  <figcaption>Figure 8</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Not easy to screw down, by the way. Even the remaining two inches of stud against the far side of the cavity were enough to prevent the use of a drill. In lieu of proper pilot holes, one would like to use an impact driver to force the screws in, but of course that wouldn‚Äôt fit either. In lieu of an impact driver, one would like to be able to use a full size screwdriver. Unfortunately even that simply hand tool would not fit into the space. Malka‚Äôs dad lent a tiny one designed for such cases, with which we forced the screws into the wood.</p>
                <p>Then it was time to build the frame.</p>
                <p>For the top and bottom (i.e. horizontal) parts, I used 2‚Äùx4‚Äù pieces. A combination of cleats and diagonals (and nails and screws) was employed, because these horizontals had to be very solidly attached to the studs behind the drywall. I only bothered to level the bottom ones, reasoning that these were most important because they were where the cabinet would rest, and anyway I could not come up with any way of leveling the top ones while I attached them.</p>
                <p>First top piece:</p>
                <figure id="fig-9">
                  <a href="images/bathroom-project/fig-9.jpg" data-lightbox="fig-9">
                    <img src="images/bathroom-project/fig-9.jpg" />
                  </a>
                  <figcaption>Figure 9</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>First bottom piece (ft. bullseye level, purchased to replace one dropped into the wall):</p>
                <figure id="fig-10">
                  <a href="images/bathroom-project/fig-10.jpg" data-lightbox="fig-10">
                    <img src="images/bathroom-project/fig-10.jpg" />
                  </a>
                  <figcaption>Figure 10</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>For the second bottom piece, I ended up securing the stud segment rotated slightly along the y-axis, because it fit better that way. Of course, I ensured no variation along the x- or z-axes. I realized after nailing and screwing it down that this was the one place where the drywall had been damaged, and it would need support from behind when spackling. So in went two shims and couple of paint stirrers to fill the gap, and in went two screws from the front.</p>
                <figure id="fig-11">
                  <a href="images/bathroom-project/fig-11.jpg" data-lightbox="fig-11">
                    <img src="images/bathroom-project/fig-11.jpg" />
                  </a>
                  <figcaption>Figure 11</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Next, the verticals. I had positioned my full-size cabinet cutout carefully: 1‚Äù away from the stud on the left, 1+3/8‚Äù away from the stud on the right. I had picked up a 3/8‚Äù-thick ‚Äúhobby‚Äù board earlier, and now all I needed was two studs 26 inches long and 1 inch thick. I figured this would be easy.</p>
                <p>At Lowes their cutting station was out of order, so I went to the Home Depot next door. (Yes, a Lowes and a Home Depot literally side by side. Strange but true.) At the Home Depot, two lumber department people told me that inch-thick wood did not exist, it was all actually ¬æ-inch. I took a tape measure and walked around, eventually finding a stair tread that was 5/4‚Äù thick and thus truly 4/4‚Äù thick. Hurrah! They couldn‚Äôt cut it lengthwise, but luckily they had one other thing in the entire store that was also 5/4‚Äù: 5/4‚Äùx6‚Äù decking material. A little too wide, especially on the side with the electrical box, but it was all they had and they couldn‚Äôt cut it lengthwise. I could make it work. I bought an 8-foot board, they cut it into 26‚Äù segments, all copacetic. One piece for the left side, one piece for the right side (to be used in combination with the 3/8‚Äù board), one extra.</p>
                <p>As it turned out, being nominally (not actually) 6 inches wide was too large even to fit into the wall that had a gap of nominally (not actually) inches, so both boards had to be cut lengthwise. No sooner said than done. Then into the wall they went. Shims jammed into tiny gaps at the top, so that any downward pressure from the severed stud would ultimately be redirected onto firm support. 3/8‚Äù padding added on the right side (not full height at only 24‚Äù, but that was okay, it was plenty to hold the cabinet tightly and the inch-thick board went up the full 26‚Äù to support the horizontal).</p>
                <p>And done!</p>

                <p>Also, y'know, I repainted the whole room, replaced rotted drywall by the bathtub, and installed totally other shelves, and we replaced the sink and vanity and toilet paper holder and shower curtain rod and light fixture, and we did several other things as well involving caulk, but I didn't take pictures of any of that.</p>
